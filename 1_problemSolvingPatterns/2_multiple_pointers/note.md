## Two-Pointer Approach
- INPUT: mostly one SORTED array input
- prevents from using 2 for-loops on same array
- index positions can be moved around to meet certain conditions
- sorted cus pointer move either toward the begining, MIDDLE or END based on condition
- OUTPUT: pair of positions/indexes or element

## Note
The two-pointer approach is a common technique used in data structure questions that involve arrays, linked lists, or strings. It involves the use of two pointers, typically initialized at the beginning of the data structure, 
and moving in opposite directions or at different speeds until they meet or some other condition is met.

#### scenarios to consider using the two-pointer approach:
- When you need to "find a pair of elements in an array" that satisfy a certain condition, such as the sum of two elements being equal to a given target value. 
    In this case, you can use two pointers that start at opposite ends of the array or linked list and move towards each other until they find a pair of elements that meet the condition.
