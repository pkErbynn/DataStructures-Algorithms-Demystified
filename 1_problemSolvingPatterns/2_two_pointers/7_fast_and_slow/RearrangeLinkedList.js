/*

Given the head of a Singly LinkedList, write a method to modify the LinkedList such that 
the nodes from the second half of the LinkedList are inserted alternately to the nodes from the first half in reverse order. 
So if the LinkedList has nodes 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> null, your method should return 1 -> 6 -> 2 -> 5 -> 3 -> 4 -> null.

Your algorithm should not use any extra space and the input LinkedList should be modified in-place.

Example 1:

Input: 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 8 -> 10 -> 12 -> null
Output: 2 -> 12 -> 4 -> 10 -> 6 -> 8 -> null 
Example 2:

Input: 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 8 -> 10 -> null
Output: 2 -> 10 -> 4 -> 8 -> 6 -> null


=======

Solution #
This problem shares similarities with Palindrome LinkedList. 
To rearrange the given LinkedList we will follow the following steps:

1. use the Fast & Slow pointers method similar to Middle of the LinkedList to find the middle node of the LinkedList.
2. once we have the middle of the LinkedList, we will reverse the second half of the LinkedList.
3. finally, we’ll iterate through the first half and the reversed second half to produce a LinkedList in the required order.
