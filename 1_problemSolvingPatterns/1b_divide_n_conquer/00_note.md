#### Binary Search
- Input: SORTED input array + Searching
- Process: requires dividing the array in half
- Output: search term

##### Note: Binary Search Vs Binary Tree Search
Binary search and binary tree search are both search algorithms used in data structure problems, but they are different in several ways.

- Binary search is used to search for a particular value in a sorted array of elements. 
    - The algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the array in half and comparing the value being searched for with the middle element of the array. 
    - Depending on whether the middle element is greater than or less than the value being searched for, the search continues in the left or right half of the array, respectively. 
    - This process is repeated until the value is found or the search range is reduced to zero.

- Binary tree search, on the other hand, is used to search for a particular value in a binary tree data structure. 
    - In a binary tree, each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child. 
    - The tree is organized such that the left child of a node contains a value that is smaller than the node's value, and the right child contains a value that is greater than the node's value. 
    - To search for a value in a binary tree, the algorithm starts at the root node and compares the value being searched for with the node's value. 
    - Depending on whether the value is greater than or less than the node's value, the search continues in the left or right subtree, respectively. 
    - This process is repeated until the value is found or the search reaches a leaf node.

- In summary, the main difference between binary search and binary tree search is:
    - the data structure being searched. Binary search is used to search for a value in a sorted array, while binary tree search is used to search for a value in a binary tree. 
    - Additionally, binary tree search requires traversing the tree from the root to the leaf node, whereas binary search only requires dividing the array in half.
