Problem Statement (Easy) #
Given an array containing 0s, 1s and 2s, sort the array in-place. 
You should treat numbers of the array as objects, hence, we canâ€™t count 0s, 1s, and 2s to recreate the array.
The flag of the Netherlands consists of three colors: red, white and blue; and since our input array also consists of three different numbers that is why it is called Dutch National Flag problem.

Example 1:

Input: [1, 0, 2, 1, 0]
Output: [0 0 1 1 2]

Example 2:

Input: [2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0]
Output: [0 0 1 2 2 2 ]


===== Brute Forces

1st Approach: using a merge sort algo
    - TC: O(n log n)
    - SC: O(1)
    - can be better? yes

2nd Approach: keeping count for unique element, and restoring element in array based on count
    - TC: O(2n) => O(n)
    - SC: O(1)
    - can be better? yes

3rd Approach: using Dutch National Flag algo, using 3 pointers
    - TC: O(n)
    - SC: O(1)

 * Right now, if there is one thing to get from these implementation so far is that;
 * 1. When you think of SORTED input array, think of BINARY SEARCH + TWO-POINTER approach
