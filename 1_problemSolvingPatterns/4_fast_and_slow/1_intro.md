###### The Fast & Slow pointer approach, also known as the Hare & Tortoise algorithm, 
- a pointer algorithm that uses two pointers which move through the array (or sequence/LinkedList) at different speeds
- useful when dealing with cyclic LinkedLists or arrays.
- To find Middle element of a LinkedList(not cyclic)

###### How?
- By moving at different speeds (say, in a cyclic LinkedList), the algorithm proves that the two pointers are bound to meet. 
- The fast pointer should eventually catch the slow pointer at some point, once both the pointers are within a cyclic loop.

- One of the famous problems solved using this technique was Finding a cycle in a LinkedList.
