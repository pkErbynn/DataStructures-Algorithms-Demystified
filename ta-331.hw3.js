// Good job! Consider avoiding comments for lines where the code is already self-explanatory as it's not a good practice, for instance:

// `stack.push(char)#, you want to push it to the stack`

// Comments like this arenâ€™t necessary, as the code itself clearly indicates the action. Aim to reserve comments for complex logic or non-obvious sections. 

// Makes sense? :)
