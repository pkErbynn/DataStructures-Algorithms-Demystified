### Data structures
- collection of data/values
- that have relationship btn them
- have functions to perform actions/operations on the data/values

- lookup: https://visualgo.net/en/list

- eg;
    1. Single Linked List
    2. Double Linked List
    3. Binary Search Trees
    3.5 Binary Heaps
    4. Queues
    5. Stack
    6. Hash Tables
    7. Directed Graphs
    8. Undirected Weighted Graphs

### Why are they many?
Because each one excels better in diff situations

- note: 
static method got nothing with instance('this') 
data often used for utility methods

### 
- Two pointers
- DFS

### Important Tip: 
1. Given:
```js
while i > n:
    i = i / 2
```
Time Complexity: O(log n)

2. Given:
```js
while i < n:
    i = i * 2
```
Time Complexity: O(log n) and not O(n)
