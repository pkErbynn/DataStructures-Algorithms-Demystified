## Intro
- The Breadth First Search (BFS) technique is used to traverse a tree.

- Any problem involving the traversal of a tree in a **level-by-level order** can be efficiently solved using this approach. 
- A **Queue** is used to keep track of all the nodes of a level before we jump onto the next level. 
- This also means that the space complexity of the algorithm will be O(W), where ‘W’ is the maximum number of nodes on any level.
