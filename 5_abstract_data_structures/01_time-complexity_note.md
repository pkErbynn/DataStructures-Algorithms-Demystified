Def: a formular function that shows how time grows as the size of the input grows

- don't case about constant cus looking at how the line is growing 
- ignore less dominating terms and take the high dominating one
- o(1) < log n < n < 2 exp n ...nlog n lies in the middle

Big-Oh
- the upper bound, can't exceed

Big Ohmega
- lower bound, opposite of big-oh
- in theta-notation

Recursion
- Space complexity = height of the tree cus that is the max fxn calls the stack can hold, then the rest becomes dynamic, del and add new
