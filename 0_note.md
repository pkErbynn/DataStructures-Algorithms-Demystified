#### Space Complexity:
- the amount of memory required by an algorithm
    - to execute a program and produce an output
    - as the input grows
- algo requires memory for storage



#### Algo & Usage time
1. Arrays
   - Best in **reading** operations
   - Poor in inserting and deleting operations (solved by SLL)
2. Singly LinkedList (SLL)
   - Best in **insertion** and **deletion** operation @ **beginning** of list
       - or at _any position_ if the pointer to the node _preceding_ the insertion or deletion position is available.
      - If you want to add or remove a node somewhere else in the list (not at the beginning), the process is also quickâ€”**but only if** you already have a pointer (reference) to the node right before the spot where you want to make the change. If you have this pointer, you can easily adjust the pointers to insert or delete a node at that position.
    - Best in **insertion** @ **end** of list
    - Poor in deletion at end (solved by DLL)
      -  inefficient because you need to traverse the entire list(with two pointers) from the beginning to find the second-to-last node and keep it as the tail
3. Doubly LinkedList (DLL)
   - Best in **insertion** and **deletion** @ beginning
   - Best in **insertion** and **deletion**([because...](https://github.com/pkErbynn/DataStructuresDemystified/blob/main/5_abstract_data_structures/2_doubly_linkedlist/1_main.js#L260)) @ end
   - Poor in control the direction of insert (end or sta)
   - Poor in insertion and deletion at anywhere middle aside beginning and end (solved by HashMap)
4. Stack
   - Best in **controlling** direction/**manner** of insertion and deletion operation
   - Best in **insertion** and **deletion/remove** **only** @ the **beginning/first** side (hence, **LIFO**)
5. Queue
   - Best in **controlling** direction/**manner** of insertion and deletion operation
   - Best in **insertion** @ **end** side and **deletion/remove** @ **beginning/first** end side (hence, **FIFO**)
6. Trees (BST)
   - Best for searching/ordering (traversal) without using an index
   - Best for insertion
7. Binary Heap
   - Best for searching/ordering (traversal) without using an index
   - Best for insertion
   - Best for deletion based on minimum or maximum value
   - Best for Priority Queue
8. Priority Queue
   - Best for reading element based on priority, whether high or low
9. HashMaps
   - Best in reading by key 
   - Best in insertion by key 
   - Best in deletion by key
10. Graphs
    - Best for searching/traversing from multiple paths unlike trees that always start from root
