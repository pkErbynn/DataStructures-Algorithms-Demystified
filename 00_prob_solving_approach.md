## Problem Solving Steps
1. **Understand** the problem
    * a. Restate in my own words
    * b. What are the possible inputs 
    * c. What are the outputs
2. Explore with concrete **examples**
    * a. start with simple examples
    * b. progress to complex examples
    * c. examples with empty inputs
    * d. examples with invalid inputs
3. **Break** problem into pieces
    * a. explicitly write out the steps to take
4. **Solve** with simplicity
    * a. locate the core difficulty part
    * b. temporarily ignore the difficulty
    * c. solve a simple solution
    * d. incorporate the difficulty back
5. **Refactor**/Optimize
    * a. improve solution
    * b. how can it be solve differently
